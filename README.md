Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 small molecule analysis and drug discovery

This set of jupyter notebooks and python scripts is used for a general analysis of biologically active small molecules against MMP9.

MMP9 is a proteinase in the extracellular matrix that is crucial for the correct modeling of the extracellular matrix structure. As such MMP9 has been linked to various physiological diseases. Inhibition of the MMP9 function has been shown to decrease cancer progression among other extracellular matrix related and cell signaling induced diseases.

The ChEMBL database offers biologically relevant data on a wide range of drug-like small molecules interacting with various protein targets. This data analysis specifically aims to uncover the underlying properties of small molecule inhibitors for MMP9. This is done through an in depth data analysis of the small molecules and their chemical properties. This leads to an eventual generation of machine learning models to establish a rule set for high affinity small molecule drugs against MMP9. The main goal is to provide an accurate bioinformatic examination and aid in the drug discovery for diseases related to this extracellular matrix proteinase.
